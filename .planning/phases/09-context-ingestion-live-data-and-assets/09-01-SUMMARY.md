# Plan 09-01: Build context, data, asset, and sync core foundation — Execution Summary

## Objective Achieved

Built the editor-core Phase 09 foundation: `ProjectBundle` now persists source records, ingestion jobs, parsed context artifacts, generated notes, web snapshots, data sources/bindings, asset lifecycle records, stable project asset URLs, and a DATA-01 foundation-only sync envelope. New helpers create deterministic source summaries, safe snapshot states, data-binding previews, asset replacement/relink history, sync diagnostics, and persisted integrity checks.

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Extend ProjectBundle context schemas | 12b011e | Added Phase 09 schemas and defaults. |
| 2 | Create context ingestion helpers | 12b011e | Added source notes, design context, parsed summaries, URL guard, web snapshot helpers. |
| 3 | Create data binding, asset lifecycle, and sync helpers | 12b011e | Added local/mock deterministic helpers and regression coverage. |
| 4 | Validate persisted context graph integrity | 12b011e | Added load-time integrity checks and adversarial persistence tests. |

## Key Files

### Created
- `packages/editor-core/src/context-ingestion.ts` — Source records, parsed summaries, generated notes, URL validation, and web snapshots.
- `packages/editor-core/src/data-bindings.ts` — Data source, binding, preview, and bundle apply helpers.
- `packages/editor-core/src/asset-lifecycle.ts` — Stable asset URLs and replacement/relink lifecycle helpers.
- `packages/editor-core/src/sync.ts` — DATA-01 foundation-only sync envelope and divergence helpers.

### Modified
- `packages/editor-core/src/schemas.ts` — Added Phase 09 persisted schemas and bundle defaults.
- `packages/editor-core/src/integrity.ts` — Added persisted reference validation for Phase 09 records.
- `packages/editor-core/src/handoff.ts` — Added source notes, design context, data, asset, and sync records to handoff includes.
- `packages/editor-core/src/index.ts` — Re-exported Phase 09 modules.
- `packages/editor-core/src/__tests__/*.test.ts` — Added and extended regression coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Phase 09 schemas and defaults exist | PASS | `sourceRecords`, `parsedContextArtifacts`, `syncEnvelope`, and related records parse. |
| Source notes and design context generated | PASS | `source-notes.md` and `design-context.md` covered by unit tests. |
| Structured summaries for document/slide/sheet/Figma/codebase/URL | PASS | Deterministic helper tests cover all input families. |
| Unsafe URL and unsupported source negative tests | PASS | `javascript:` and localhost are rejected; unsupported source creates blocked diagnostics. |
| Data binding helpers validate mappings | PASS | Missing source fields return error diagnostics. |
| Asset replacement/relink preserves audit records | PASS | Stable `kdesign://asset/...` URLs and lifecycle events covered. |
| Sync helper remains DATA-01 foundation-only | PASS | Diagnostics explicitly preserve hosted-sync boundary. |
| Persisted corruption probes reject missing references | PASS | Generated notes, parsed artifacts, snapshots, bindings, assets, URLs, and sync corruption covered. |

## Lint Gate

**Status:** PASS

- `pnpm --filter @kdesign/editor-core build`: PASS
- `pnpm --filter @kdesign/editor-core test -- src/__tests__/context-ingestion.test.ts src/__tests__/data-bindings.test.ts src/__tests__/asset-lifecycle.test.ts src/__tests__/sync.test.ts src/__tests__/persistence.test.ts`: PASS
- `npx eslint packages/ --max-warnings 0`: PASS
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: PASS

## Deviations

`packages/editor-core/src/export.ts` did not need code changes. Handoff now includes the generated notes and Phase 09 provenance records without changing the clean HTML export source-of-truth path.

## Self-Check

PASS
